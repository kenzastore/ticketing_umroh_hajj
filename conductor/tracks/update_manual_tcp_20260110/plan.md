# Plan: Update User Manual for Split PNR and TCP Validation

This plan outlines the steps to update the user documentation to match the latest TCP validation features.

## Phase 1: Documentation Updates
Update existing manual stages and the main index with Split PNR and TCP validation guidance.

- [x] Task: Update Stage 1 Demand Intake - Add clarification for TCP vs Group Size in `docs/manual/stage1_demand_intake.md`. 1e5eb7a
- [x] Task: Update Stage 2 Operational Execution - Add "Handling Split PNRs" section with validation rules and UI instructions in `docs/manual/stage2_operational_execution.md`. 1e5eb7a
- [x] Task: Update Main Index - Add Terminology/Glossary section to `docs/manual/index.md`. 1e5eb7a
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Documentation Updates' (Protocol in workflow.md) [checkpoint: 1e5eb7a]

## Phase 2: Verification and Cleanup
Ensure documentation links and cross-references are valid.

- [ ] Task: Verify Links and Rendering - Check that all internal links between manual stages are still functioning and the Markdown renders correctly.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Verification and Cleanup' (Protocol in workflow.md)
