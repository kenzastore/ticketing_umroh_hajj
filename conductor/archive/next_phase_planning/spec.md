# Track Spec: Next Phase Planning

## Overview
This track focuses on analyzing the current state of the application against the `conductor/product.md` requirements and defining the next set of granular development tracks to reach MVP complete status.

## Objectives
1.  **Gap Analysis:** Compare implemented features (Request, Movement, Invoice UI) vs. MVP requirements (Payment, PDF, Reminders, Audit).
2.  **Define Tracks:** Create specific, actionable tracks for the missing modules.
3.  **Prioritization:** Order the tracks based on dependencies and business value (e.g., Payment is critical for "Ticketing Done" logic).

## Inputs
- `conductor/product.md`: The project roadmap.
- Current Codebase State: `app/models/`, `public/finance/`, `public/admin/`.

## Outputs
- Updated `conductor/tracks.md` with new tracks.
- A brief summary of the plan.
