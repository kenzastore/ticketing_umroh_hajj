# Product Guidelines: Digitalisasi Ticketing Umroh & Haji

## 1. Tone and Voice
- **Friendly & Approachable:** Use a welcoming tone that builds a sense of partnership with the user, while maintaining the necessary clarity for financial and logistical tasks.
- **Supportive:** Instructions should feel like helpful guidance rather than rigid demands.

## 2. Design Principles
- **Efficiency & Speed:** Every interaction should be optimized for quick completion. Field staff on mobile need to perform actions with minimal taps.
- **Task-Oriented Simplicity:** The UI should focus on the current task at hand, removing distractions and unnecessary information.
- **Mobile-First Utility:** Prioritize the usability of "quick actions" (uploading proof, updating status) on small screens.

## 3. Communication & Feedback
- **Urgent Notifications:** Use high-contrast visual cues (red/yellow colors, warning icons) for critical items like unpaid deposits or "FP Merah" locks requiring immediate attention.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provide clear, instant confirmation when a user completes an action, especially for financial uploads.

## 4. Terminology
- **Industry Standard Jargon:** Use established terms like `PNR`, `FID`, `FP Merah`, `QUOTED`, and `BLOCKED`. Users are experts in their field, and the app should speak their language to maintain trust and precision.
- **Consistency:** Once a term is used for a status or a field, it must be used identically across all modules and reports.

## 5. Trust & Reliability
- **Audit Transparency:** Subtle indicators should show that actions are being logged, reinforcing the "single source of truth" concept.
- **Data Integrity:** Clearly distinguish between "estimated/quoted" data and "confirmed/locked" data.
